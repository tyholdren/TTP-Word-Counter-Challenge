# Project Title

Word Count Challenge

## Description

I've completed the word counter challenge, and created a few additional features where one can:

retrieve letter frequency
find words inside of other words
get the percentage of the word length from a string

ADDITIONALLY!
Please view the app I built using Spotify's API!

### Dependencies

- node

### Installing

Though not necessary, I've created a test file where you can run tests. If you would like to do use this feature, run "npm install" in your terminal, then run "npm run test".

### Executing program

Navigate to your terminal and run the following command

```
node text-info.js
```

You should be able to place your tests in the terminal now.

## Help

If you are not getting the expected results from your tests, view the algo.test file to view the format of each string used to test each function. You may have to adjust your inputs accordingly.

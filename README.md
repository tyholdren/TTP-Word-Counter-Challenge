# Project Title

Word Count Challenge

## Description

I've completed the word counter challenge, and created a few additional features where one can retrieve letter frequency, find words inside of other words, and get the percentage of the word length from a given input.

In addition to this challenge, I've also created an app using Spotify's API. View it here: [Spotify Application](https://github.com/tyholdren/Spotify-App)

### Dependencies

- node

### Installing

Though not necessary, I've created a test file where you can run tests. To use this feature, run "npm install" in your terminal, then run "npm run test".

### Executing program

Navigate to your terminal and run the following command:

```
node text-info.js
```

You should be able to place your tests in the terminal now.

## Help

If you are not getting the expected results from your tests, view the 'algo.test' file to view the format of each string used to test each function. You may have to adjust your inputs accordingly.

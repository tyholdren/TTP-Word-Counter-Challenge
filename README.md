# Word Count Challenge

In addition to this challenge, I've also created an application using Spotify's API. View it here: [Spotify Application](https://github.com/tyholdren/Spotify-App)

## Description

Completed the word counter challenge and created extra features.<br><br>

Required Features

1. Character Count
2. Word Count
3. Sentence Count
4. Paragraph Count
5. Bigrams (counts of unique pairs of words)

Extra Features

1. Letter Frequency
2. Find Words in Words
3. Get Percentage of Word Length<br><br>

### Dependencies

kdkdkd

- node <br><br>

### Installing

Though not required, I've created a test file where you can run tests. To use this feature, run "npm install" in your terminal, then run "npm run test".<br><br>

### Executing program

Navigate to your terminal and run the following command:

```
node text-info.js
```

Now you can place your text in the terminal and see their respective outputs.<br><br>

## Help

If you are not getting the expected results from your tests (possibly the paragraph test), reference the 'algo.test' file to view the format of each input used to test each function. You may have to adjust your inputs accordingly.
